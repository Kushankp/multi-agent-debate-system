# 🧠 Multi-Agent Debate System

## 💡 Project Idea
This project explores the use of multiple AI agents that **debate complex topics** from opposing viewpoints (Pro vs Con) under the supervision of a **moderator agent**.  
The goal is to analyze how **collaborative and adversarial reasoning** among LLMs can improve argument quality, reasoning depth, and factual alignment.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pinecone** for vector search and knowledge retrieval (RAG)
- **SentenceTransformers** for embedding generation
- **Streamlit / React (optional)** for frontend visualization

---

## 🚀 Overview
- Each debate involves:
  - A **Pro Agent** (argues in favor)
  - A **Con Agent** (argues against)
  - A **Moderator Agent** (evaluates and declares a winner)
- Optional integration with Wikipedia embeddings for grounded responses.
- Designed for research on **multi-agent reasoning**, **alignment**, and **AI argumentation**.

## 🧩 Planned Features
- Multi-round debates with agent memory  
- Fine-tuned argument scoring and evaluation models  
- Visual debate interface for real-time user interaction  
- Integration with multiple knowledge sources (Wikipedia, news, papers)  
- Logging and analytics dashboard for debate quality tracking
